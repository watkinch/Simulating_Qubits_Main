    Non-meandered CPW class that combines A* pathfinding algorithm with

    2. Checks if connect_simple is valid each time we pop from the heap. If so, use it, otherwise proceed with A*.
    3. Tweaks connect_simple to account for end anchor direction in determining which CPW (elbow or S-segment) to use.
