    """The base `TransmonPocketCL` class.

    Inherits `TransmonPocket` class.

    Create a standard pocket transmon qubit for a ground plane,
    with two pads connected by a junction (see drawing below).

    Connector lines can be added using the `connection_pads`
    dictionary. Each connector line has a name and a list of default
    properties.

    This is a child of TransmonPocket, see TransmonPocket for the variables and
    description of that class.

    BaseQubit Default Options:
        * connection_pads: empty Dict -- The dictionary which contains all active connection lines for the qubit.
        * _default_connection_pads: empty Dict -- The default values for the (if any) connection lines of the qubit.

    TransmonPocket Default Options:
        * pad_gap: '30um' -- The distance between the two charge islands, which is also the resulting 'length' of the pseudo junction
        * inductor_width: '20um' -- Width of the pseudo junction between the two charge islands (if in doubt, make the same as pad_gap). Really just for simulating in HFSS / other EM software
        * pad_width: '455um' -- The width (x-axis) of the charge island pads
        * pad_height: '90um' -- The size (y-axis) of the charge island pads
        * pocket_width: '650um' -- Size of the pocket (cut out in ground) along x-axis
        * pocket_height: '650um' -- Size of the pocket (cut out in ground) along y-axis
        * _default_connection_pads: Dict
            * pad_gap: '15um' -- Space between the connector pad and the charge island it is nearest to
            * pad_width: '125um' -- Width (x-axis) of the connector pad
            * pad_height: '30um' -- Height (y-axis) of the connector pad
            * pad_cpw_shift: '5um' -- Shift the connector pad cpw line by this much away from qubit
            * pad_cpw_extent: '25um' -- Shift the connector pad cpw line by this much away from qubit
            * cpw_width: 'cpw_width' -- Center trace width of the CPW line
            * cpw_gap: 'cpw_gap' -- Dielectric gap width of the CPW line
            * cpw_extend: '100um' -- Depth the connector line extends into ground (past the pocket edge)
            * pocket_extent: '5um' -- How deep into the pocket should we penetrate with the cpw connector (into the fround plane)
            * pocket_rise: '65um' -- How far up or downrelative to the center of the transmon should we elevate the cpw connection point on the ground plane
            * loc_W: '+1' -- Width location  only +-1
            * loc_H: '+1' -- Height location only +-1

    Default Options:
        * make_CL: True -- If a charge line should be included.
        * cl_gap: '6um' -- The cpw dielectric gap of the charge line
        * cl_width: '10um' -- The cpw trace width of the charge line
        * cl_length: '20um' --  The length of the charge line 'arm' coupling the the qubit pocket.
          Measured from the base of the 90 degree bend.
        * cl_ground_gap: '6um' -- How much ground is present between the charge line and the
          qubit pocket.
        * cl_pocket_edge: '0' -- What side of the pocket the charge line is.
          -180 to +180 from the 'west edge', will round to the nearest 90.
        * cl_off_center: '50um' -- Distance from the center axis the qubit pocket is referenced to
